We successfully developed a comprehensive bicycle rental management system utilizing RFID technology. The system includes a user-friendly web application that allows users to seamlessly pay for and rent bicycles through our platform. Once the payment is processed, users can unlock the bicycles using an RFID tag, enabling a convenient and secure rental experience. This project effectively integrates RFID technology with modern web development to provide an efficient and user-centric solution for bicycle rentals.
